# Overview

## Introduction to OpenUSD

Universal Scene Description (USD) is a comprehensive framework for interchangeably representing 3D scenes and
animations. Developed by Pixar, it aims to improve collaboration in the 3D graphics pipeline. The core feature of USD is
its ability to efficiently encode a 3D scene's composition, geometry, shading, lighting, and animation data in a
layered, override-able, and editable format.

### The significance of USD in the 3D graphics and VFX industry

<note>
    USD has become increasingly significant in the 3D graphics and VFX industry for several reasons:
</note>

- **Collaboration:** It allows teams to work on different aspects of the same scene simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Interoperability:** USD's ability to be used across different software packages streamlines the workflow and reduces
  the need for conversions.
- **Non-destructive edits:** Layering and overrides allow for non-destructive edits, meaning original data can be
  preserved while allowing for variations.
- **Performance:** USD is designed to handle the complexity and size of today's cinematic productions, supporting large
  datasets and high-performance streaming.

## History and Evolution

### The origins of USD at Pixar and its evolution into an open standard

USD was initially developed by Pixar to facilitate the complexities of 3D film production. Recognizing the potential
broader impact, Pixar released USD as an open-source project to encourage standardization and development. Over time, it
has evolved with contributions from various industry leaders, becoming a foundational technology in the 3D, VFX, and
gaming industries.
